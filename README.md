# T-splines for matlab

This a matlab implementation of T-splines by Sederberg et al. 
It includes T-spline approximation using skinning as described in "Approximate T-spline surface skinnging" by Yang et al. (2012).

## Getting Started

The project includes two testfiles (tSplineTest.m, tSplineTest2.m) that show basic usage.

### Prerequisites

This project inlcudes an implementation of B-splines by Levente Hunyadi (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27374-b-splines) as well as the nurbs toolbox by D.M. Spink (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26390-nurbs-toolbox-by-d-m-spink).
